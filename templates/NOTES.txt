To get started with your new deployment, you can run the following command to check the status of the deployed resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "MyMicroBotDemo.fullname" . }}"
```

If you enabled ingress, you can access the application using the following URL:

{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
https://{{ .Values.ingress.hostname }}
{{- else }}
Ingress is not enabled. You can enable it by setting `ingress.enabled` to `true` in your values file.
{{- end }}


If you enabled TLS for ingress, please ensure that the certificate has been issued successfully before accessing the application over HTTPS. You can check the status of the certificate with:

```bash
kubectl describe certificate {{ include "MyMicroBotDemo.fullname" . }}-tls
```
